# IAM Failure Simulator

IAM Failure Simulator is a lightweight security analysis tool that explains how
AWS IAM misconfigurations can realistically evolve into security incidents.

This project focuses on **explainability** rather than raw detection.

---

## What this tool does

- Analyzes IAM Users and Roles
- Identifies over-privileged permissions
- Maps risky permissions to realistic incident paths
- Explains where incidents could have been prevented

The output is designed to be understandable by both engineers and non-engineers.

## Why this project exists

Many security incidents are not caused by missing tools,
but by misaligned understanding between technical teams and decision makers.

As a former sales professional, I observed that:
- Risks were detected but not acted upon
- IAM warnings lacked context and urgency
- Security decisions failed due to poor explanation

This tool was built to close that gap.

## Intended audience

- Cloud / Platform Engineers
- Security Engineers
- Solutions Architects
- Technical Sales and Security Advisors

Especially those responsible for **explaining risk**, not just detecting it.

---

## Disclaimer

- This tool does NOT perform any attacks
- All incident paths are analytical simulations
- Intended for educational and preventive purposes only

## 日本語概要（簡易）

IAM Failure Simulator は、AWS IAM の設定が
どのように現実的なセキュリティ事故へ発展しうるかを
「説明可能な形」で可視化する分析ツールです。

検知ではなく、理解と意思決定を目的としています。
